# Pillsbury Pizza Pop Price React App
Front end app that displays product data in a cell-like format for pre-defined local vendors near Vancouver, BC Canada.  This relies on the back end API app that I also built called [Pizza Pop Price Scraper](https://github.com/robertshum/Pizza-Pop-Price-Scraper).

## Vendors
Currently, the project scrapes the following vendor websites:\
Save-on-foods\
Pricesmart\
Superstore\
Your Independent Grocer\

Only showing 4 vendors at the moment, the back end API has more.

# How it Works

This app fetches JSON data from the back end API and displays the product details of each item.

# Features

*Search allows for users to type in products to scrape\
*Lists the results of the scrape in a single page app.\
*Links open up to the product page\
*Responsive to different screen resolutions / sizes.

# Installing / Running the Project

1. Clone the project
2. Clone the back end API [Pizza Pop Price Scraper](https://github.com/robertshum/Pizza-Pop-Price-Scraper)
3. npm install and node . for the back end API
4. npm install and npm start for the front end app


# Limitations

1. The app relies on the back end API, either hosted locally or deployed somewhere else (ideally with proxy rotation).
